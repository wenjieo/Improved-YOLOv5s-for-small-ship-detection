A small ship detection method based on spanning connections, Hybrid Spatial Pyramid Pooling, Coordinate Attention mechanism and EIOU (Improved YOLOv5s) is proposed.

We created a new ship dataset called OSSD, which has 10,133 images and corresponding label files.

Notes: Weighted-Add-IPNH denotes the skip connections adopted the weighted fusion approaches and sum features up. Add-IPNH denotes the skip connections directly sum features up. Weighted-Concat-IPNH denotes the skip connections adopted the weighted fusion approaches and concatenated features. Concat-IPNH denotes the skip connections without weighted concatenated features.
